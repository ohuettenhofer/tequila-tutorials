    "If you're new to Tequila, we recommend starting with [Tequila Basics: Getting Started](../tq-get-started/index.qmd) to familiarize yourself with the core concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the SPEX backend?\n",
    "**SPEX** is an expectation-value computation module for Tequila, implemented in C++ and specialized in sparse Pauli states. In typical quantum computations, a wavefunction can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{x=0}^{2^n - 1} c_x \\, |x\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When n is the number of qubits, and $c_x$ are complex amplitudes. Many simulation backends store all $2^n$ amplitudes, even if most of them are zero. In contrast, **SPEX** uses a **sparse representation**, keeping track only of non-zero amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **SPEX** can be advantageous for **sparsely occupied states**, e.g., states that are mostly zero except for a small number of basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: If your wavefunction is dense (i.e., almost all basis states have non-negligible amplitudes), then another simulator might be more straightforward. However SPEX will still function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the post, we will see a usecase from quantum chemistry where spex works quite nice.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "First make sure the core Tequila package is installed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tequila-basic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the SPEX module:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install spex-tequila\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install on MacOS:  \n",
    "The PyPi installation will work, but might struggle with using threads. A workaround is to install the gcc compiler suite (e.g. with homebrew) and then install spex directly from source\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install gcc-14\n",
    "CC=gcc-14 CXX=g++-14 pip install git+https://github.com/Mikel-Ma/spex\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure Tequila recognizes the SPEX backend:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tequila as tq\n",
    "print(tq.available_simulators)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing expectation values using SPEX\n",
    ">Note: Because SPEX operates on exponential Pauli gates, it is most efficient if your circuit is already expressed using ExpPauli(...) gates. This way, you avoid extra compilation steps or transformations. If you use high-level gates like Rx, Ry, CNOT, and so on, Tequila will still convert them, but providing ExpPauli gates directly can eliminate unnecessary overhead.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tequila as tq\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "U = tq.gates.ExpPauli(paulistring=\"X(0)Z(1)\", angle=np.pi / 2)\n",
    "H = tq.QubitHamiltonian(\"Z(0)\")\n",
    "E = tq.ExpectationValue(U=U, H=H)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate with SPEX:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = tq.simulate(E, backend=\"spex\")\n",
    "print(\"Expectation value:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using parallelization\n",
    "You can control the number of threads by setting environment variables such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export SPEX_NUM_THREADS=4\n",
    "```\n",
    "or:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "alternatively, you can use the argument *num_threads*:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = tq.simulate(E, backend=\"spex\", num_threads=4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not set any of those variables, SPEX will use all available cores on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Thresholds\n",
    "The SPEX backend uses two important thresholds, an amplitude threshold and an angle threshold, to keep the simulation efficient by pruning negligible contributions. Both thresholds default to *1e-14*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amplitude Threshold:\n",
    "Any amplitude with an absolute value below this threshold is removed from the simulation. This ensures that only significant contributions are kept in the sparse state representation, reducing numerical noise and memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Angle Threshold:\n",
    "If a gate’s rotation angle is below this threshold, the gate is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can adjust these thresholds via the arguments *amplitude_threshold* and *angle_threshold*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = tq.simulate(E, backend=\"spex\", amplitude_threshold=1e-12, angle_threshold=1e-10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: If you want to disable pruning and use all elements, you can set the thresholds to *None*. Be aware setting the amplitude_threshold to *None* may significantly impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compressing Qubit Indicies\n",
    "SPEX automatically compresses qubit indices to minimize state size. If you prefer to disable this behavior, use:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = tq.simulate(E, backend=\"spex\", compress_qubits=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How SPEX works\n",
    "### State representation\n",
    "SPEX represents quantum states as **sparse dictionaries** of non-zero amplitudes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "|ψ⟩ = {\n",
    "    0b00: (1.0 +0j), # |00⟩\n",
    "    0b11: (0.0 -1j) # |11⟩\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit implementation\n",
    "In SPEX, a quantum circuit is a sequence of exponential Pauli gates. Each such gate can be thought of as an operator of the form:\n",
    "$$e^{-i\\theta P},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is a product of Pauli matrices ($X$, $Y$, or $Z$).\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exponential Pauli gate is applied, the simulator processes each non-zero amplitude in the dictionary. It first determines how $P$ flips or phases the corresponding basis state. Then, it computes updated amplitudes using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lvert\\psi_{new}\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\lvert\\psi\\rangle -i\\sin(\\theta/2)P\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: By using fewer, larger Pauli exponentials, SPEX can process each gate in one pass over the sparse dictionary, minimizing overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hamiltonian structure\n",
    "Every Hamiltonian is expressed as:\n",
    "$$H = \\sum_{k} c_kP_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each $P_k$ is a tensor product of Pauli matrices (e.g., $X \\otimes Z$), and $c_k$ are (complex) coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Term-wise expectation value calculation\n",
    "To compute the expectation value $\\langle \\phi\\lvert H\\rvert \\psi\\rangle$, SPEX operates term by term:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SPEX applies $P_k$ to $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$ to obtain $\\lvert\\psi_k\\rangle$:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SPEX iterates over each non-zero basis state in $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$, depending on the Pauli operator:\n",
    "    - **X**: Flips the qubits $\\lvert0\\rangle→\\lvert1\\rangle$\n",
    "    - **Y**: Flips the qubit and multiplies by a phase $\\pm i$\n",
    "    - **Z**: Multiplies by $-1$ if the qubit is $\\lvert1\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SPEX computes the overlap $\\langle\\phi\\lvert\\psi_k\\rangle$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using the same dictionary structure, SPEX finds matching basis states in $\\lvert\\phi\\rangle$ and $\\lvert\\psi_k\\rangle$ and sums up the product of their amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SPEX accumulates the result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ \\langle\\phi\\lvert P_k\\rvert\\psi\\rangle\\cdot c_k $$  \n",
    "    This process is repeated for each term $c_kP_k$ and the results are summed, resulting in $\\langle \\phi\\lvert H\\rvert \\psi\\rangle$.\n"
