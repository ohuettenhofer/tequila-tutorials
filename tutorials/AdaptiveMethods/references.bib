	abstract = {We develop computationally affordable and encoding independent gradient evaluation procedures for unitary coupled-cluster type operators{,} applicable on quantum computers. We show that{,} within our framework{,} the gradient of an expectation value with respect to a parameterized n-fold fermionic excitation can be evaluated by four expectation values of similar form and size{,} whereas most standard approaches{,} based on the direct application of the parameter-shift-rule{,} come with an associated cost of expectation values. For real wavefunctions{,} this cost can be further reduced to two expectation values. Our strategies are implemented within the open-source package Tequila and allow blackboard style construction of differentiable objective functions. We illustrate initial applications through extended adaptive approaches for electronic ground and excited states.},

@article{vqe,
	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry---calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He--H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

@article{Grimsley:2019aa,
	abstract = {Quantum simulation of chemical systems is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers. The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},
